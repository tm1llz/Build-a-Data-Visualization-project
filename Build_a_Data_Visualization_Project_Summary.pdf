What were the number of views per states in the US in 2023? The report of the US map shows which states had the most views in 2023. California and Colorado where the leaders at 100 million views for their respective states.
What were the number of views from 2001 to 2023? The number of YT views increased from 2001 with a peak in 2014, however during the pandemic of 2020 there was a significant decrease in viewership. I would imagine that this is due to all of us being glued to the news seeing what new developments or precautions we need to take to prevent contracting COVID-19.
Which states in the United States had the most likes and dislikes of 2023?
California being a leader of views in 2023 also had the most likes in the US. The state of Georgia with 92 million views had the most dislikes of the states.

Which YouTube Channels generated the largest number of average viewers?
YT spotlight, Almaviva, and LuisFonsVEVO where the top 3 channels that had the largest number of average viewers. I am not familiar with these channels per YT MalmuaVEVO Hispanic artists music channels. YouTube Spotlight is also what YouTube was formerly called and it is the “official YouTube channel for the American video sharing platform, YouTube, spotlighting videos and events on the platform”. (reference https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_(channel)#:~:text=YouTube%20(formerly%20YouTube%20Spotlight)%20is,and%20events%20on%20the%20platform.)

Which YT Channel categories are the most liked and disliked?
Music is the category that generated the most likes. This is understandable as many of my colleagues and I listen to YouTube music while working. YouTube offers music and audio videos as well as a premium service where you can watch your videos without adds but for a fee. The most disliked category was entertainment. I did find this
surprising as I would have presumed news and politics would have been the most disliked category.
Design: I chose classic designs for my visualizations. I did not want the data to get lost in eccentric designs.
Resources: I used a quote from Wikipedia to explain what YT spotlight was, it is referenced in my summary.
